# Class 4 notes - HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML

1. **To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**
an `<a>` element using the `href` attribute.

2. **The href attribute contains what information?**
The web address.

3. **What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

- Dont repeat URL as part of link text

- Dont use 'link' or 'links to' in the link text

- Keep link text as short as possible

- Minimize instances of using the same text to link to different places.

## CSS

1. **What is meant by “normal flow”?**
The way webpage elements lay themselves out by default.

2. **What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**
Block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimensions. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content.

3. **___ positioning is the default for every html element.**
Static positioning is the default.

4. **Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**
An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. It sits on its own layer seperate from everything else.

5. **What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**
Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## JS

1. **Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**
Declaring is how you define or create the function. Invoking is how you call or run the function.

2. **What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**
They are the same

## Misc

1. **Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

- Job interview readiness - This is one of the areas I feel I would like the most preparation for.

- Engaged collaboration - I feel this is extremely valuable for both learning and career satisfaction.
