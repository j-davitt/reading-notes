## HTML Media

`alt` is used for screen readers and could also be useful for troubleshooting broken links.

`PNG` so that there is no loss under compression.

## CSS

1. **Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**
Imagine an HTML element as a box that you are looking into from above. The background would be like laying out a sheet on the bottom of the box. The foreground would be any items you put in the box on top of that sheet.

How the chosen font is supported for different browsers.

4. **What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?**
`font-size` changes the size of the text. `font-weight` changes how bold a text is. `font-style` changes the style of font.

You could use `word-spacing` and `letter-spacing`
