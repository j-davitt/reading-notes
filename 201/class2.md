**Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.**
You can use functions to solve math equations and many other things.

### Conditionals

An if statement checks a **statement** and if it evaluates to **true**, then the code block will execute.

**What is the use of an `else if`?**
`else if` is used to chain extra outcomes to an `if...else`

**List 3 different types of comparison operators.**
`===` tests if a value is identical to another. `<` and `>` test if a value is greater or less than another. `<=` and `>=` test if a value is less than or equal to or greater than or equal to.
