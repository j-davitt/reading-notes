# Class 8 notes - CSS Layout

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. **Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
It takes a bunch of items which have different sizes and returns the best layout for those items.

2. **Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**
Main axis is set by the `flex-direction` property. `row` or `column`. The cross axis runs in the other direction to main axis. If main axis is `row`, cross axis is `column`.

3. **How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**
A screen reader will follow the logical order of how things are ordered in the HTML document no matter how it is deisplayed onto the webpage. `row-reverse` or `column-reverse` will display the information backwards but wont change how a screen reader will see it.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. **What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**
Flex is easier to use when:

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.

- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless af how much is available.

- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even is they contain a different amount of content.

2. **How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**
I need to learn CSS because I am not very proficient right now.
