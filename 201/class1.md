HTTP sends a request  to a server for a webpage, the server sends the webpage back as data packets.

A browser parses the HTML file first, allowing it to recognize any CSS and JavaScript links. The browser sends requests to the server for any CSS and JavaScript files and then parses those. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML and an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS. The webpage can then be seen and interacted with in the browser.

You can find images to use with Google. Save the image or the URL. Images can be filtered by usage rights to not use copyrighted material.

In JavaScript, `strings` are created with quotes, whereas `numbers` are not.

`Variables` are containers that store values. They are a necessary part of programming.

An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

Attributes contain extra information about a given element. An attribute should have a space between it and the element name. The attribute name followed by an equal sign. An attribute value in quotes.

`<article>` encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own. `<section>` is similar but is more for grouping together a single part of the page. Best practice to begin each `<section>` with a heading.

Most websites contain nav bars and footers.

The metadata allows search engines to display the description of your webpage.

The `<meta>` tag is used within the `<head>` of an HTML page and gives info to the browser.

First step in designing a webpage: **define what you want to accomplish with it.**

Semantics should be used in HTML to represent the data contained and leave the styling to CSS. `h1` will be a top level header and `span` will make it look like one. Search engines and screen readers will consider them differently.

JavaScript can be added to a HTML page using the `<script>` tag. JavaScript is required to store information in variables as well as running code within a webpage.
