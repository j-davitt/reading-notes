# Class 9 notes - Forms and JS Events

## HTML Forms

1. **Why are forms so important in web development?**
Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a website and a user.

2. **When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**
Keep it simple and focused.

3. **List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**

- `form` - this defines a form
- `label` - labels the input field
- `input` - single line input field
- `textarea` - multiline text input field
- `button` - allows user to submit the form

## JS

1. **How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?**
An event is any action that happens within a system. ie clicking a button or an image.

2. **When using the `addEventListener()` method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?**
The name of the event and a function to handle the event.

3. **Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**
It allows us to program more features and access to information. `event.target`

4. **What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?**
event bubbling fires on the inner most nested element and works its way out, event capturing is reversed.
