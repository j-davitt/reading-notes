# Class 10 notes - Debugging

## Troubleshooting JS

1. **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
Syntax errors are spelling errors and will usually provide error messages. Logic errors are when the code is not working as intended and will usually not include error messages.

2. **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
Plenty of syntax errors but I used the console to find what line they were on.

3. **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
This will be a constant element of my career I am sure.

## JS Debugger

1. **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
It allows you to pause at certain points in your code to ensure everything is working as intended.

2. **Define what a breakpoint is.**
A breakpoint is where code execution is paused.

3. **What is the call stack?**
Shows what code was executed to get to the current line of code.
