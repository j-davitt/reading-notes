# My reading journal for Code Fellows 102

My name is Joe Davitt and I am excited to set out on this career path.

To me, a growth mindset is keeping an open mind and believing I have the ability to persevere through *hard work and dedication.* 

>3 reminders to stay in a **growth mindset:**
>
>- Accept that I will struggle at times.
>- Keep my eyes on the end goal.
>- Learn from others.
