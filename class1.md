Markdown is a way to format your page with easy syntax without having to use html.

Basic syntax include:

- `#`,`##`, etc for headings
- `** **` for bold text
- `* *` for italic text
- `*** ***` for bold and italic text
- quote text with `>`
- create links with `[name](url)`
- add image using `![text](img url)`
- ``use ` ` for code``
- use angle brackets for easy linking emails or url `<example@example.com>`
