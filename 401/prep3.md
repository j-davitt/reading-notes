# Engineering

- **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**
My perspective and life experiences as a father, a foreman, and USMC veteran. I believe these things help push me to be successful and I am determined to accomplish whatever task is at hand.

- **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**
Allow myself to fail. I will try to take it one step at a time to see if I can figure it out. If not, I will seek guidance from a mentor.
