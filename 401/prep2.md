# Growth Mindset

## Emotional Intelligence

I scored 13 on Self-Awareness. This seems about right as I am notoriously self-unaware. I scored a 17 on Self-Management. This seems like I may have graded myself harshly because I feel like I can self-manage well. I also scored a 17 on Social-Awareness. I feel that my social awareness is about the same as my self awareness. And finally, I scored a 16 on relationship management. I think my relationship management is pretty good but I see it can use some work.

## Bias

In the self assessment, my strongest areas were: What is bias, and bias and the brain. My weakest areas were: Four ways to act, and empathy and curiousity. In total I scored 83. I still have much to learn and apply but I am a work in progress.
