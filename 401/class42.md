# Class 42 notes - Ethics in Tech

## Ethics in the workplace

As software takes a bigger role in peoples lives by the day, it is important to consider the ethics of the software we build. What might seem like no big deal to us, could have a huge impact on someone else. In the example I read, the author talked about writing a quiz that always pointed the user to the same drug. That drug would later be found to cause severe depression. This points out the importance of considering the impact and unintended consequences of our code.

## Ethics in tech

The example I read was about self driving cars. It points out the need for prioritizing the safety of either the passengers or others on the road. At some point this priority will have to be decided by the software. This is a very difficult decision to make, and it is important to consider the ethics of the decision.
