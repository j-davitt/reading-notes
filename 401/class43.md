# Class 43 notes - Gatsby, next.js, and others

## Teach us two things about Next.js.
Next.js supports pre-rendering with both server-side rendering and statis site generation. Server-side rednering is a way to render a page on the server and then send the fully rendered page to the client. Static site generation is a way to pre-render a page at build time and then serve the static HTML file to the client. Next.js also supports API routes which can build out endpoints for your application.

## Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.

Gatsby has a data layer that can be used to pull data from any source. Data can be stored in a local file system, a content management system(CMS), or a database. Each source plugin pulls data from a specific source and adds it to your site's GraphQL data layer. Gatsby also has a plugin system that allows you to extend the functionality of your site. Plugins can be used to add features like support for Sass, UI frameworks, and more(much like NPM).
