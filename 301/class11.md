## SQL vs NoSQL

- **Find 5 differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.**

> - SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
> - SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
> - SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
> - SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
> - SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.

- **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
Non-heirarchical data storage

- **Give a real world example.**
Oracle

- **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
Heirarchical data storage

- **Give a real world example.**
MongoDB

- **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
NoSQL

- **Which type of database is best for scalability?**
SQL

## Video

- **What does SQL stand for?**
Structured Query Language

- **What is a relational database?**
the database works with certain assumptions with SQL

- **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**
tables

- **What is a ‘schema’?**
requirement for data to be stored

- **What is a NoSQL database?**
flexible data storage without tables

- **How does it work?**
collections instead of tables, documents are like the rows

- **What is inside of a MongoDB database?**
key value pairs

- **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
MongoDB, no schema you can add new data

- **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
duplicate data
