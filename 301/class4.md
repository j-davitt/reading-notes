# Class 4 notes - React and Forms

## Forms

1. **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**
An input form element whose value is controlled both by setState and user input

2. **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**
as soon as they enter them so that it is available in state sooner

3. **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**
add a name attribute

**The Conditional (Ternary) Operator**

1. **Why would we use a ternary operator?**
less lines of code

2. **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**
` x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)`
