# Class 1 notes - Intro to React and Components

## Components

1. **What is a “component”?**
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

2. **What are the characteristics of a component?**
Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

## Props and React

1. **What is “props” short for?**
properties

2. **How are props used in React?**
passing data from one component to another.

3. **What is the flow of props?**
uni-directional flow. One way from parent to child.
